# The Effective Workplace Manifesto

## Introduction

We recognize that creating an effective workplace is crucial for an organization's success. This encompasses efficient onboarding of new team members, transparent documentation management, and streamlined processes throughout the employee lifecycle. This manifesto serves as a guide to create a welcoming, informative, and productive work environment.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency**: All information should be easily accessible and clearly communicated.
2. **Efficiency**: Streamlined processes and tools should facilitate quick integration and ongoing productivity.
3. **Personalization**: Tailor the workplace experience to each individual's role and needs.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly seek feedback and iterate on workplace processes.

## Pillars

### 1. Company Information
- Provide quick access to HR management tools
- Clearly communicate company regulations and policies
- Share the company's culture, values, and vision

[Details and examples](docs/en/company-information.md)

### 2. Project Information
- Offer simplified access to project management tools
- Document team processes (e.g., writing pull requests, managing tickets)
- Clearly identify resource persons for each area of expertise
- Describe deployment processes and provide explanatory diagrams
- Centralize useful shared resources (documentation, articles, cheat sheets, videos)
- Implement credential management tools and security policies
- Ensure compliance with GDPR and other applicable regulations

  - List of authorized and unauthorized tools
  - Details of granted accesses

[Details and examples](docs/en/personal-information.md)

### 4. Welcome Process
- Schedule introduction meetings with key stakeholders
- Prepare a welcome kit (goodies, equipment, documentation)
- Establish a progressive integration program
- Assign a mentor or buddy to support the new team member
